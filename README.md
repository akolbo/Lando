Lando
=====

Lando is a new kind of CMS that lets you manage your website in The Cloud! Just save files in your Dropbox and they'll appear on your site. It has support for pages, posts, drafts, text snippets, and file collections that you can turn into cool things like galleries and slideshows.

How It Works
------------

During installation, Lando creates the folders it needs in your Dropbox along with some demo content. You can then start adding to your site by creating folders and files.


Themes
------

Lando comes complete with a versatile, responsive default theme for a small website/blog and can be easily customised with custom themes written in PHP.
