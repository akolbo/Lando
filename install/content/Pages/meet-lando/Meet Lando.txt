[Lando][l] is a new kind of CMS that lets you manage your website in The Cloud! Just save files in your [Dropbox][db] and they'll appear on your site. It has support for pages, posts, drafts, text snippets, and file collections that you can turn into cool things like galleries and slideshows.

This page exists as a [Markdown][md]-formatted text file in the _/Pages_ folder of your Dropbox. Its filename is used as the page title and parent folder name as the URL slug (_about-lando_).

For a full run-down of features and tips on using Lando, visit [the website][l].
