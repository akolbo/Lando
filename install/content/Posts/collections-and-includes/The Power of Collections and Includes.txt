You can easily create galleries and slideshows from files in _/Collections_. Just drop an include into a page, post, draft or snippet with code like `\{{gallery "Collection Title"}}`.

{{gallery "Star Wars Posters"}}

You can even pass parameters such as `\{{slideshow title:"Collection 2" speed:400 size:m}}` and order collection files with filename prefixes.

{{slideshow title:"Star Wars Posters" size:m}}

Listing files without thumbnails? You can output a simple linked list with `\{{collection "Collection 3"}}`:

{{collection "Star Wars Posters"}}

That's not all! Check out the documentation on [collections][c] and [includes][i] for the full run-down of possibilities.
