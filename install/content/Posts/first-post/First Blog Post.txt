This is your first blog post! It lives in a sub-folder of _/Posts_ in your Dropbox named with the post URL slug (_first-post_). The filename is used as the post title, and metadata can be added at the top of the file from overriding the publish date, to tags, to [pretty much anything you like][meta].

This post is formatted as [Markdown][md], but you can format your posts in [a number of ways][ff]. If you're logged in as an [admin][], try editing this file, saving, and clicking **Update** in the top right of the page.

Lando makes blogging easy. Enjoy!
