[Markdown][md] is a lightweight markup language that lets you format your Lando content without any complicated tags like HTML. Created by [John Gruber][jg], it is intended to be "as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible".

Basic Formatting
----------------
To create a paragraph, just use double line breaks.

You can _emphasise_ text with single `*asterisks*` or `_underscores_` or make text **bold** by using `**two**`.

Headings
--------
Level 1 and 2 headings are done by underlining with `===` or `---` respectively:

    Heading 1
    =========

    Heading 2
    ---------

You can create smaller headings (up to level 6) using `### Heading 3` (number of `#`s corresponds to heading level).

Links
-----
There are two ways to create [hyperlinks](#): `[link text](http://the-url.com)` or with a `[reference][1]` and then the URL later in the document: `[1]: http://landocms.com`.

Images
------
Similar to links but prefixed with an exclamation mark: `![Alt Text](image.jpg)` or `![Alt Text][1]` with the reference further down the document: `[1]: image.jpg`.

Footnotes
---------
Footnotes[^1] are done with references too, using `[^1]` and `[^1]: The footnote.` at the bottom of the document.

Lists
-----
You can make a bulletted list by starting each line with `*`, `-` or `+`:

* This
- Has
+ Bullets

Or a numbered list by starting with `1.`, `2.` etc:

1. A New Hope
2. The Empire Strikes Back
3. Return Of The Jedi

Quotes
------
Blockquotes are prefixed with `>` like in an email:

> A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

Tables
------
You can even use pipes and dashes to create tables, so:

    Column 1      | Column 2
    ------------- | -------------
    Cell data     | Cell data
    Cell data     | Cell data

Becomes:

Column 1      | Column 2
------------- | -------------
Cell data     | Cell data
Cell data     | Cell data

Section breaks
--------------
You can break up sections with a horizontal rule using `---` or `***`:
