tags: markdown, formatting, tips


[Markdown][md] is a lightweight markup language that lets you format your Lando content without any complicated tags like HTML. Created by [John Gruber][jg], it is intended to be "as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible".

Here's a rundown of what you can do with Markdown. Open the text file for this post in your Dropbox to see how it's formatted.

---

To create a paragraph, just use double line breaks.

You can _emphasise_ text with single `*asterisks*` or `_underscores_` or make text **bold** by using `**two**`.

There are two ways to create [hyperlinks](#): `[link text](http://the-url.com)` or with a `[reference][1]` and then the URL at the bottom of the document: `[1]: http://landocms.com`.

Images can be inserted in similar ways but prefixed with an exclamation mark: `![Alt Text](image.jpg)` or `![Alt Text][1]` with the reference further down the document: `[1]: image.jpg`.

Footnotes[^1] are done with references too, using `[^1]` and `[^1]: The footnote.`


Headings
========

Above is a level 1 heading underlined with `===`. Underline with `---` for a level 2 heading:

Smaller Heading
---------------
You can create even smaller headings (up to level 6) using `### Heading 3 ###` (number of `#`s corresponds to heading level).

Blockquotes are prefixed with `>` like in an email:

> A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

You can make a bulletted list with `*`, `-` or `+`:

* This
* List
- Has
+ Bullets

Or a numbered list:

1. A New Hope
2. The Empire Strikes Back
3. Return Of The Jedi

And you can break up sections with a horizontal rule using `---` or `***`:
